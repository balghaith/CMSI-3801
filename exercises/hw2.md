I skimmed a few course notes and done as much as I could.
I would like to give credit to ChatGPT and Professor Toal for helping me in this assignment.

Q1: Because it seems like a programmer may use a line of code usefully when in reality they can't since there's actually nothing reffered to. This often leads to system crashes and harder debuggings which therefore leads those systems to be unsafe enviroments to work on.

Q2: He intoduced it to allow programmers to quickly refrence functions that dosen't lead to anything. This meant that all refrence types were allowed accsess to it and made it super convinent since it could immediatly set an object to be empty. 

Q3: 3**35 means that 3^35. Therefore, if we calculated it, we would get 50031545098999707 according to Python's calculator. Since Python has "int" in its langauge, it has the ability to calculate numbers as high as you wanted to. However, Javascript limits its calculator abilites to 2^53, which in this case, Javascript couldn't calculate our number.

Q4: We would basically need a dictonairy:
{"x": 3, y: 5, "z": z}

Q5: Because it converts values into the same type. Therefore, if we want to use the equal sign in javascript, we would need to use 3 equal signs "===" in order to assign 2 values to be equal to each other and not be the same type.

Q6: function arithmeticsequence(start, delta)
       return coroutine.create(function()
          local current = start
          while true do
            coroutine.yield(current)
            current = current + delta
          end
        end)
      end

* I got help from an AI tool to help me out with this problem as I got stuck.

Q7: a: 1x1-1 = 0
    b: 1x3-1 = 2

Q8: Because static scoping gives the programer the option to define the variables in their code and use it at all times, making it more efficant since it already has the program aware of that variable. Shallow binding refers to the latest values of a variable and would need to access other functions/lines of code in order to get their meanings.
