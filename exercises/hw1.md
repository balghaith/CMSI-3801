## Q1
Filtering is picking certain things from a specific list based on a certain rule.

Example (Python):

```python
ints = [10, 20, 30]
print(list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, ints)))
```

## Q2
(numbers .^ 3)

---

## Q3
How programming languages could be utilized in our everyday lives.

---

## Q4
This starts off by taking the inputs it received, followed by verifying whether each number is even or odd. If it’s odd, it proceeds while leaving even numbers out. It then squares all remaining integers (odds) and adds the squares.

---

## Q5
Back then, data used to be shared via messages from small independent objects as they used to hide the data.  
Today, it is easily accessible as today's definition suggests that data is grouped in classes, which eases its accessibility.

## Q6
1st Letter: U+1400 which corresponds to the letter A  
2nd Letter: U+1405 which corresponds to the letter I  
3rd Letter: U+1440 which corresponds to the letter N  
4th Letter: U+1473 which corresponds to the letters NGA  
5th Letter: U+1405 which corresponds to the letter I  

It means hello, or "Salam" in Arabic.

## Q7
Control flow is ensuring that the program runs smoothly by completing one task at a time, while concurrency means handling many tasks at once.

---

## Q8
Machine Learning refers to the bits that group each other (specifically the 0's and 1's) that the CPU runs.  
Assembly language is basically the same idea, but instead we have the programmer dealing with actual words that map to those bits.

Example using the letter B & 0x2005:

**Assembly:**
```
LDA #$42
STA $2005
```

**Machine Code:**
```
A9 42 8D 05 20
```

## Q9
Ruby:

```ruby
def f(n) = n.even? ? 4*n - 3 : 3*n + 1
```

## Q10
I'm 99.99% sure that all students in CMSI3801 have at least tried a game developed with this language once. Verse serves as a crucial backbone of the video game of our generation, Fortnite. It was developed in 2023 by Epic Games, the group behind Fortnite, and led by Simon Peyton Jones to introduce new standards to the industry. It was aimed to enhance the safety measures for its users as well as fast reactions to incidents that happen in-game.

Functional logic refers to the idea of writing small functions that keep data the same while writing simple rules. These rules then get searched by the computer to figure out which are true. The small functions then come into play to do all the math for us.
