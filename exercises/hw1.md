Q1: Filtering is picking certain things from a specific list on a certain rule.
Ex: Python
int = [10, 20, 30]
print(list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, int)))

Q2: (numbers .^ 3)

Q3: How programming langauges could be utilized in our everyday lives.

Q4: This starts off by taking the inputs it recieved, followed by a quick inspection of verifying wheather its even or odd. If its odd, it proccedes while leaving even numbers to go. It then squares all remaining integers (odds) and adds the squares.

Q5: Back then, data used to be shared via messages from their small independent objects as they used to hide the data. Today, it is easily accsessible as today's definition suggests that data is grouped in classes which eases its accsessibility.

Q6: 1st Letter: U+1400 which corresponds to the letter A
    2nd Letter: U+1405 which corresponds to the letter I
    3rd Letter: U+1440 which corresponds to the letter N
    4th Letter: U+1473 which corresponds to the letters NGA
    5th Letter: U+1405 which corresponds to the letter I
It means hello, or "Salam" in Arabic.

Q7: Control flow is ensuring that the program runs smoothly by completing one task at a time, while concurrency means handling many tasks at once.

Q8: Machine Learning refers to the bits that group each other (specificaly the 0's and 1's) that the CPU runs. Assembly language is bascially the same idea but instead we have the programmer dealing with actual words that links to those bits.

My example will be based on the letter B & 2005.
Ex (Assembly): LDA #$42
               STA $2005
Ex (ML): A9 42  8D 05 20

Q9: Ruby: def f(n) = n.even? ? 4*n - 3 : 3*n + 1

Q10: I'm 99.99% sure that all students in our CMSI3801 have atleast tried a game developed by this language once. Verse serves as a crucial backbone of the video game of our generation, Fortnite. It was developed in 2023 by Epic Games, the group behind Fortnite, and led by Simon Peyton Jones to introduce new standerds to the industry. It was aimed to enhance the saftey measures for its users as well as fast reactions to the incidents that happen in game. Funcitional logic refers to the idea of writting small functions that keeps data the same while writting simple rules. These rules then get searched by the computer to figure out which are true. The small functions then come to play to do all the math for us.
